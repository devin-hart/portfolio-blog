## Project Summary

NorthShoreCommercialDoor.com approached us for a full site rebuild, migrating from a different platform. The transition required extensive support to ensure a smooth migration while preserving key functionalities. We worked closely with them to not only replicate and enhance their existing features but also introduce new functionality, delivering a faster, more efficient, and user-friendly website.

## Full Site Features

As part of the NorthShoreCommercialDoor.com rebuild, we implemented several key features to enhance the user experience and improve product accessibility, including:

- [Exploded Parts View](https://www.northshorecommercialdoor.com/sears-craftsman/epv/model-20057933-opener-parts/) – A detailed, interactive breakdown of product components for easier part identification.
- [Product Manual Display & Downloads](https://www.northshorecommercialdoor.com/xcroblgadore.html/#tab-manual) – Seamless access to manuals directly on product pages, allowing users to view or download with ease.
- Discontinued Product Template – A structured layout for discontinued items, providing alternative product suggestions and relevant information.

These additions helped streamline navigation, improve customer support, and ensure a more intuitive shopping experience.
