## Project Summary

OdorFreeMachines.com approached us with a request for a _Model Selector_—a tool designed to suggest the best products based on a customer’s specific needs and selections. The goal was to create a seamless, user-friendly experience that guided shoppers toward the most suitable solutions, simplifying the decision-making process.

## Project History

Like many projects, OdorFreeMachines.com’s request seemed straightforward at first—build dropdowns that link to specific pages. However, I quickly realized the complexity behind it. The sheer variation in odor types and location selections added unexpected layers of logic. On top of that, the client wanted user selections to persist across pages, ensuring a seamless experience.

This project was also one of my first opportunities to work closely with a client, translating their exact vision into functionality. It reinforced the importance of clear communication, adaptability, and delivering a solution that felt intuitive to both the client and their customers.
