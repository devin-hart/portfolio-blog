## Addon Description

A Make-Model-Year (MMY) Addon is a powerful tool designed for eCommerce stores that sell parts, accessories, or any products requiring compatibility filtering. It allows customers to quickly find products that fit their specific product by selecting the make (manufacturer), model, and year from dropdown menus.

My updated Make-Model-Year (MMY) Addon was a significant improvement over our previous version. The original implementation required merchants to manually fill out a CSV file, mapping category information to each make, model, and year. This process was time-consuming and prone to errors.

In the updated version, I leveraged GraphQL to streamline performance and eliminate the need for manual CSV uploads. This approach significantly improved speed, automation, and accuracy, allowing the system to dynamically fetch and filter category data without extra input from the merchant. The result was a more efficient, scalable, and user-friendly solution for both store owners and customers.
