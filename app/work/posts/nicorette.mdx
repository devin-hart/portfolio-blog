## Project Summary

We were brought in by Nicorette to execute a full site build under a tight timeline. The project involved implementing multiple static content pages—each with its own unique design—while ensuring pixel-perfect execution across devices. I worked closely with Nicorette’s design team to translate their vision into clean, performant frontend code, and delivered the entire build ahead of schedule by putting in a full weekend of work.

## Full Site Features

The Nicorette.com build included several key custom features and pages, such as:

- [**Product Quiz**](https://www.nicorette.com/product-quiz) – A custom-built stepper that guides users through a short questionnaire and funnels them to a sign-up form. Designed for ease-of-use and optimized for both mobile and desktop.

- [**Explore Products**](https://www.nicorette.com/explore-products) – A fully custom layout that showcases the brand’s full product range with clean visual hierarchy and direct navigation paths.

- [**Why Quit Smoking**](https://www.nicorette.com/why-quit-smoking/impact-on-body) – A multi-section educational experience with rich static content and responsive layout, built to spec from separate design files.

Despite the time crunch, the launch was successful and aligned precisely with Nicorette’s standards for design, clarity, and accessibility.
