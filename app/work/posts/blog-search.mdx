## Addon Description

The Blog Search Addon is an input bar that incorporates a fuzzy search feature, allowing users to quickly find blog posts that match what they're typingâ€”even if the search terms are not an exact match. This flexible search functionality makes it easier to discover relevant content, even with slight variations or typos in the search query.

The addon utilizes GraphQL for optimal performance, fetching only the necessary data for faster search results. This ensures a dynamic, real-time search experience, providing users with near-instant results while reducing server load and improving overall efficiency.
