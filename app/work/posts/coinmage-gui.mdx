## Why this project?

CoinMage GUI grew out of a freelance project that never made it past the prototype stage. The original build queried the Benzinga API for merger and acquisition data, but once the trial ended, the cost of continued access made the project unsustainable. Rather than scrap the work, I pivoted and rebuilt it around CoinGecko’s free API, adapting the layout and cards to match the different data set.

Because I had already developed reusable components and patterns from the CLI version, the transition was quick. In the end, I produced a streamlined React frontend, a new incarnation of my earlier CoinMage CLI that delivers live crypto data without the API paywall.

## About the Project

CoinMage GUI is the browser-based counterpart to the original CoinMage CLI. It isn’t as feature-packed as the CLI, but it’s far more accessible and easier for the average user to pick up.

### Features:
- **Search for Coins**: Users can search for a coin by its name, symbol, or a shorthand alias (e.g., "BTC" for Bitcoin).
- **Market Data**: For each coin, users can view detailed data including:
  - Current price
  - Market cap rank
  - 24-hour price change
  - Volume and circulating supply
  - All Time High (ATH)
  - All Time Low (ATL)
  - Sparkline Chart
