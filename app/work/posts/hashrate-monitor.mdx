## Why this project?

I mine cryptocurrency across a ragtag fleet of devices — phones, Pis, and old PCs — and needed a way to keep tabs on everything. Terminal tools are great when I’m on a laptop, but I wanted something that worked well on mobile too. Not another bloated dashboard with login walls and analytics — just a simple, clean UI that shows me what I care about: live stats and worker performance.

**Hashmon** was built to scratch that itch. It runs as an Android app built with Python and Kivy, designed to be minimal, informative, and fast. No ads, no tracking, no nonsense — just your data, at a glance.

## About the Project

Hashmon is a mobile dashboard that monitors real-time stats from XLA and Salvium mining pools via the Fastpool API. It shows live hashrates, payouts, worker performance, and a countdown to the next refresh.

### Features:
- **Real-Time Stats**: Pulls and displays up-to-date pool data for both XLA and Salvium.
- **Worker Breakdown**: View each worker’s name and current hashrate in a clean, sortable grid.
- **Refresh Countdown**: A progress bar shows time until the next data refresh.
- **Auto-Refresh**: Data refreshes on an interval with an animated transition.
- **Highlight Top Worker**: The highest-hashrate worker per coin is highlighted for visibility.
- **Mobile-First UI**: Built with Kivy and KivyMD, optimized for Android devices.
- **Offline Support**: Fails gracefully if the network is unavailable.
