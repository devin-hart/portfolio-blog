## Tool Description

Pre-configured stylesheets are a curated collection of stylesheets organized by each site section. These stylesheets come pre-filled with the elements commonly found on the page that would typically need adjustments based on a designâ€”such as headers, footers, buttons, and typography.

The goal is to provide a starting point for developers, offering a framework where they can easily tweak and adjust individual elements to match the specific design requirements, without needing to start from scratch. This setup accelerates development by reducing repetitive tasks and ensuring that consistency is maintained across site sections.
