## Project Summary

GeoNetworking.com engaged us for a complete site rebuild, transitioning from a different platform. The migration required careful planning and support to maintain existing functionality while improving performance. We collaborated closely with them to preserve, refine, and expand their site's capabilities, ultimately delivering a faster, more intuitive, and feature-rich user experience.

## Full Site Features

As part of the GeoNetworking.com rebuild, we integrated several essential features to enhance user experience and optimize site functionality, including:

- [Video Hero Section (top of the homepage)](https://geonetworking.com/) - A visually engaging, fully responsive hero section featuring high-quality video content to capture attention.

- [Brand Product CTA (bottom of the homepage)]() – Located below the Proud Authorized Dealer section on the homepage, this dynamically pulls specific products for a selected brand, improving visibility and navigation.

- [Specs Information Tab (below the product image and order form)](https://geonetworking.com/rod-level/) – Integrates static page content directly into the product’s Specs tab, ensuring customers have easy access to detailed specifications without leaving the product page.

These enhancements helped create a more intuitive and informative shopping experience for customers.
