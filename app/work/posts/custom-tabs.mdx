## Addon Description

The Custom Tabs Addon allows merchants to create and display custom tabs on their Product Detail Pages (PDPs), giving them the ability to add additional information in a structured, organized way. These tabs can be used for various purposes such as product specifications, FAQs, reviews, sizing guides, or any other details that help inform customers. This feature enhances the product page by making content more accessible and improving overall user experience without cluttering the main product information section.
