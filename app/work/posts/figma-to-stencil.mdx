## Tool Description

The Figma to Stencil (BigCommerce) CLI is an internal tool I developed to streamline the process of converting Figma designs into stylesheets for use in Stencil projects. The tool automatically extracts styles for basic elements, typography, and colors directly from Figma, eliminating the need for manual coding and ensuring consistency across designs. This automation speeds up the development process by providing a quick, reusable, and reliable foundation for styling components in Stencil.

I wrote the Figma to Stencil CLI early in my career as a weekend project, but it quickly became an essential tool in our development workflow. What started as a small, personal initiative to automate the extraction of design styles from Figma turned into a staple in our development process, significantly improving efficiency and consistency in the way we handled stylesheets for Stencil projects. It was rewarding to see a simple idea evolve into something that was widely used and added real value to the team.
