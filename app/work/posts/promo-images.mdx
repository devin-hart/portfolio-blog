## Addon Description

The Promotional Image on Categories addon enables merchants to showcase promotions or advertisements within category pages, seamlessly integrating them into the product grid. These promotions, designed to resemble product cards, can link to specific products or informational pages. Merchants have the flexibility to position them in a designated spot or have them appear randomly within the grid for greater visibility.
