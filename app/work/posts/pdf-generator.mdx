## Project Summary

I developed functionality that dynamically generates PDFs using the information found in the product page tabs. This automation ensures that PDFs always reflect the latest product details without requiring manual updates.

## Project History

ENPAC approached us for a solution to streamline their workflow, as they were manually updating product pages and uploading PDFs to their WebDAV. After refining the design and scope, my project manager and I collaborated closely with the client to ensure their requirements were met in both functionality and design. The final solution allowed for dynamic PDF generation, eliminating redundant work and improving efficiency.
