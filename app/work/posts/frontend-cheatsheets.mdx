## Why this project?

A couple weeks ago, during a recruiter screening, I was asked what a “closure” was. I've heard the term. I’ve used closures in my code. I understand what they do. But I didn’t have a textbook answer locked and loaded, so I had to say, “I don’t know.”

It wasn’t a job interview—just a call to assess where I’m at technically. Still, it never feels great to blank on something you do know but can’t articulate. It’s like being asked, “What’s the fulcrum on a hammer?” Most people wouldn’t be able to define it on the spot. But show them and they’ll go, “Oh, of course.” Not knowing what or where the fulcrum is doesn’t stop you from using a hammer correctly—and likely relying on it every time.

That’s what this project is about. It’s a cheatsheet. A study guide. Flash cards for the deeper concepts in JavaScript, React, React Components, and TypeScript. All aimed at helping me go from “I know how to use this” to “I can explain it clearly.” So the next time someone asks me about closures, I won’t hesitate.

## About the Project

This is a simple app that loads content from markdown files based on the selected topic in the top bar. Each topic—JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Components—has its own cheatsheet written in markdown. The app parses and displays them cleanly, and includes a flashcard mode that breaks each file into bite-sized chunks for review. It's built to help me study, lock in definitions, and stop blanking on things I already know how to use.


### Features:

- **Topic-based Navigation**  
  Select between JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Component topics in the top bar.

- **Markdown Rendering**  
  Parses and styles markdown files into readable cheat sheets.

- **Flashcard Mode**  
  Splits each topic into flashcard-style sections for focused review.

- **Keyboard Navigation**  
  Use arrow keys to flip through flashcards (← / →).

- **Mobile Support**  
  Responsive layout with fixed navigation and repositioned flashcard controls.

- **Persistent Top Bar**  
  Top bar stays visible for easy topic switching without screen jump.

- **Default Topic**  
  Loads JavaScript by default when the app starts.
