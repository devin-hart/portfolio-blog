## Project Summary

Glerup had previously purchased the Interval Quantity addon, which allows merchants to restrict product purchases to specific intervals (demo link below). Typically, this functionality is managed through Custom Fields—short fields used to store additional product information and control certain customizations. However, Glerup wanted to leverage BigCommerce’s metadata instead, streamlining the process and enhancing flexibility.

Additionally, the client requested that key product details—such as price, size, and minimum order quantity—dynamically update based on option selections, ensuring a seamless and intuitive shopping experience.

## Project History

This project presented several challenges:

1. Working with BigCommerce Metadata
At the time of development, BigCommerce’s metadata was only accessible via GraphQL—a feature I hadn’t previously worked with in this context. While I was comfortable querying data with GraphQL, using it to retrieve metadata was a new experience, requiring some exploration and adaptation.

2. Evolving Requirements & Inconsistent Data
The client requested additional functionality twice after the initial scope was defined. While flexibility is part of any development process, the real challenge lay in the inconsistent formatting of the metadata they provided. This made it difficult to ensure scalability and maintain a streamlined approach.

3. Adapting the Interval Quantity Addon
The Interval Quantity addon is well-written but was designed to function in a specific way—it wasn’t built to dynamically adjust quantities. Integrating the client’s dynamic requirements while preserving the addon's core functionality required creative problem-solving and careful implementation.

In an ideal world, projects come with a clear, well-defined scope and consistent data structures. In reality, requirements shift, constraints emerge, and adaptation becomes key. Some of the best parts of coding come from navigating this chaos, finding solutions, and making things work—no matter the challenge.
