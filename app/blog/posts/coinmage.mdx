## Why this project?

When you switch over to Linux, you get comfortable with the terminal real fast. Some things are just faster, cleaner, and more direct in the shell — and let’s be honest, there's something kind of badass about flying through commands like you’re Crash Override in *Hackers*. Welcome to the world of CLIs.

If you’ve read my [Who Am I?](/other/about-me) post, you know I’m into building cryptocurrency miners. I don’t just build rigs — I also invest in crypto. And if you’ve spent any time in the space, you already know how wild the market can be. It’s volatile. It moves fast. It crashes while you’re sleeping and spikes while you’re distracted. So yeah, I check prices often.

I use [CoinStats](https://coinstats.app/) to track my portfolio and hit up [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) when I want to dig into a specific coin. But sometimes, I just want the info fast — no navigating, no clicking through five pages to get to the number I already know I want. That’s how CoinMage came to life: a CLI that gives me what I need, right from the terminal, with zero fluff.

## About the Project

CoinMage is a command-line application that allows you to track cryptocurrencies, view market data, and watch live coin prices with real-time updates. The application fetches its data from CoinGecko, one of the most comprehensive cryptocurrency APIs available.

### Features:
- **Search for Coins**: Users can search for a coin by its name, symbol, or a shorthand alias (e.g., "BTC" for Bitcoin).
- **Market Data**: For each coin, users can view detailed data including:
  - Current price
  - Market cap rank
  - 24-hour price change
  - Volume and circulating supply
- **Watchlist**: Users can create and manage multiple watchlists. The app will track live prices for all the coins in a user-defined watchlist.
- **Live Coin Watch**: This feature allows users to track selected coins in real-time, displaying their price and percentage changes.
- **Trending Coins**: The app can display trending coins on CoinGecko, giving users insight into which coins are getting attention.
- **Top Coins**: The top 10 coins by market capitalization can be shown for quick access.

### Key Updates:
- **Improved Coin Ranking**: When searching for coins, the app now selects the coin with the **highest market cap rank** if multiple coins share the same name or symbol.
- **Sparkline Charts**: Users can view a 7-day sparkline chart showing the price trend of a coin, providing a quick visual representation of price fluctuations.

CoinMage is continuously evolving with new features and improvements aimed at making cryptocurrency tracking more accessible and enjoyable for all users.
