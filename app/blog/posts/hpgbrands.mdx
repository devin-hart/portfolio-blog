## Project Summary

HPGBrands approached us after purchasing a theme from the BigCommerce marketplace, seeking customization to better align with their vision. While the core structure of the theme remained intact, extensive customizations were implemented to tailor it to their specific needs.

## Project History

This project came with its fair share of challenges:

1. Third-Party Marketplace Themes – While these themes offer a feature-rich and cost-effective alternative to a fully custom build, they are often rigidly structured and lack support when issues arise. This made customization more complex.

2. Unique Business Requirements – The client had a highly specific way of operating their business, requiring the site to accommodate several unconventional requests. Many of these were beyond standard functionality, demanding creative problem-solving.

Fortunately, the client was highly responsive and had a clear vision, which eliminated guesswork and streamlined the process. While this was one of the more challenging projects I’ve worked on, it was also a rewarding one.
