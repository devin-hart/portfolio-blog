## Project Summary

WorldVapeUSA approached us with a request to enhance their account creation process by adding file upload functionality and incorporating additional fields for new accounts. This upgrade streamlined customer onboarding, ensuring a smoother registration process while capturing the necessary information efficiently.

## Project History

The main challenge with this request was that BigCommerce doesn’t natively support file uploads during account creation. I needed to find a way to seamlessly create accounts on WorldVapeUSA’s store while also collecting the required license documentation from new users.

To solve this, I leveraged JotForm, allowing users to upload their files through a custom form. The submission process now uploads documents to JotForm while simultaneously creating an account in BigCommerce, ensuring a smooth approval workflow. This solution provided the necessary functionality without disrupting the store’s existing system.
