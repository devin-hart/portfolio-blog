Ever since my dad brought home his [Toshiba Satellite work laptop](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlk1wqemy/image/upload/v1743776738/toshiba-laptop_wb7an3.webp) and we installed America Online in the early '90s, I’ve been hooked on computers and the Internet. There was something about that era — maybe it’s nostalgia, maybe rose-colored glasses — but the early web had a kind of charm. Sites were weird, designs were all over the place, and you could always tell what was a link. Nothing had to be mobile responsive. Every page felt handmade. It was chaotic, imperfect, and creative — the Wild West. And honestly, I miss it.

Now everything feels the same. Sites are built for Google first, users second. Mobile-first design, SEO compliance, accessibility lawsuits, and social media monopolies have all pushed the web into this sanitized sameness. Every site looks like a template. Every blog post reads like it was engineered for ranking, not for people. We traded personality for performance scores. There’s less discovery, less individuality. The freedom that made the early Internet feel alive is slowly being strangled out.

This site was built with React and TypeScript, deployed on Vercel — but the design is a love letter to the early web. It’s simple. Clean. Not buried in trackers, modals, or cookie prompts. No animations for the sake of animation. You’d think, with a background in graphic design, I’d have gone flashier. But after years of watching clients butcher their own sites to chase trends or solve imaginary UX problems, I always find myself thinking back to how it used to be. Not perfect, but personal. Not optimized, but human.
